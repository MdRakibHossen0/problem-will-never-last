<h1>Dhaka Metro Rail</h1>
<h3> The Dhaka Metro Rail (Bengali: ঢাকা মেট্রোরেল), or simply the Dhaka Metro, is a mass rapid transit system serving Dhaka, the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. It is operated by the Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited (DMTCL).[2] Together with the under construction Dhaka BRT, proposed Dhaka Subway and Dhaka suburban circular rail, it is expected to reduce traffic congestion in the city. The metro rail network has five planned lines which are the MRT Line 6, the only operational line, MRT Line 1 and MRT line 5, which are under construction, and MRT Line 2 and MRT Line 4, which are in the planning stages. It is part of the Strategic Transport Plan outlined by the Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority (DTCA).</h3>
<h4> Construction</h4>
The deal for the construction of the MRT Line-6, costing US$2.8 billion, was signed by the government of Bangladesh with the Japan International Cooperation Agency on 20 February 2013.[19] Construction began on 26 June 2016 with an inauguration ceremony presided over by the prime minister Sheikh Hasina.
<h4><em>Planning</em></h4>
When construction commenced in 2016, the Metro Rail was expected to open by the end of 2019.[20] By 2018, this expectation was still held to, but by 2019, completion of phase one was delayed to December 2021.[24] In 2018, the second phase was expected to be complete by December 2020.[24][25] Eventually, these dates were pushed back, with phase one opening in 2022 and phase two expected in 2023.[26] The main reason for the delays from 2020 to 2022 was the COVID-19 pandemic.[27]<br>
